# React Finance App (without Redux)

Simple Finance Manager app built with React

This is my first React app. I decided to build it without Redux to learn about the components, 
states, props and everything else. You can add items (expenses or incomes), filter items by 
date or text and clear the filters. You can also delete expenses and incomes.

You can try it out in here: https://felipegalvao.github.io/react-finance/public/index.html

Now, I'm going to rewrite it with Redux, and then add some features like Login with Firebase, 
and I'll also add tests.

The new repo URL is: https://github.com/felipegalvao/react-finance-redux
